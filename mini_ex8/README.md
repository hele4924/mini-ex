The program is a kind of search engine that shows a headline from the online edition of the newspaper The Guardian. Both the program and the code are very simple. The API URL, the search word and the apikey sends a query to The Guardian’s database to find headlines that contains the search word and then return with ten headlines that matches this query. 
The data returned from the page can seem a bit unmanageable, but when parsed it is easier to see the logic behind the output of the program. The ten headlines that the API returns, is within the ‘response’-array and the program only shows the second headline within the array.
