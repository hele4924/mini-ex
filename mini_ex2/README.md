[Blue Man Program] https://rawgit.com/hele4924/mini-ex/master/mini_ex2/empty-example/index.html


**Description of program**

The program looks like a face where the user can control the movement of the mouth by moving the mouse. First of all, to make this feature I had to use the ‘vertex()’ syntax which allows me to draw whatever I want, in whatever shape I want. This command only askes for x and y coordinates. The same with the ‘curveVertex()’ that makes the mouth round. But instead of entering a y-coordinate it is defined by the movement of the mouse. 
The second feature of the blue man program is the left-eye-blinking and the pink cheeks. This happens when the ‘mouseIsPressed()’. This feature did give me a lot of trouble when I tried to program it. In the beginning I tried to put this movement under the function ‘mousePressed’, but for some reason nothing happened. I still do not know why that is. But it made me discover the ‘If mouseIsPressed()’ which, I think, is not a function. 
Another thing that gave me trouble during the programming, was the fact that I could not figure out how the different command are ranked in terms of which shape is on top of the other. 


**My program and fun**

I think my program catches a lot of different kinds of fun. The obvious one, is fun in relation to humour. The program is, in my eyes, something that makes you smile, because of the silliness of the looks on the face when you move the mouse and form the mouth in strange position. To modulate a face into something strange looking, is a classic element seen in all kinds of comic/humoristic entertainment. Properly, it is something we have done ourselves by ex. drawing a mustage or glasses on a portrait in the newspaper. 

In relation to mode of thinking, the idea definitely arises from real-world context as described above. Here the advantage of the program is that you can modulate the face however you want without taking the persons feelings or boundaries into account. Properly, this would have been even more fun if you could manipulate the face more. 

In relation to geekiness, the program definitely offered a lot of pleasurable breakthroughs. My technical focus in this program was to get to know how to “freehand-draw” something and to make a movement. As mentioned before I had problems with the function ‘mousePresses()’ where I could not make it functional, so it was a breakthrough when I discovered the ‘if mouseIsPressed()’. These kinds of experiences during the programming is what keeps the process rolling and developing because is fun to understand something you did not understand before.
