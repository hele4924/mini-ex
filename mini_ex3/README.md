[The Loading Program](https://rawgit.com/hele4924/mini-ex/master/mini_ex3/empty-example/index.html)


My goal for this mini exercise was to understand the throbber showed I class by winnie (sketch03_a) and to get familiar with the use of array and Boolean variables.  

I definitely found it hard to figure out the code behind winnie’s throbber, but after playing around with the numbers I got an idea. The only thing I still find a little confusing is the calculation of the possible positions ( var cir = 360/num*(frameCount%num);).
The arrays are a great tool for having a shift in form, colour etc. without having to calculate/operate yourself because you can automate these. 
The Boolean variables makes sense to me in theory, but when are tried to limit the area of where the press will result in new colour of the rectangle, it did not work.  

Relation to temporality 
The program is an interactive throbber where the colour of the rectangle shifts from black to random or the other way around, when the mouse is pressed. In the beginning, the purpose of this throbber was to entertain the user by its interactivity, hoping it could make them willing to wait even longer. But somehow, when I had finished coding the colour change of the rectangle, I realised how distracting and flickering the program looked and instead, i tried to emphasise that. I did this to provoke the annoying feeling it creates to, hopefully, make the user become aware of the waiting time and participate in it.
The program does not direct the users attention to the process happening behind the interface, but rather to the way we (do not) spend a moment waiting for the process to finish.
