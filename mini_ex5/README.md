[The fly catcher](https://rawgit.com/hele4924/mini-ex/master/mini_ex5/empty-example/index.html)

For this assignment I wanted to create some kind of game. The idea is that the frog is supposed to catch the flies and thereby gain points. I could not finish the game and I especially had problems with keeping the flies inside the canvas.
My class is the flies. Their attributes are only their start position on the canvas. I thought about making others, like size and colour, but I figured these attributes seems so insignificant in the reality. But with that said, I’m sure they matter to some extent. Properly it has some effect on the fly’s ability to survive. 
The flies’ method is to move. I tried to make their movement kind of random like Daniel Shiffmans balls, but unfortunately their movement became a bit weird and mechanic after I tried to avoid them leaving the canvas. Again, I made a choice to only show part of the real-life fly’s movement, since it also crawls, stands still, etc. 
So even though you do not doubt the circles on the screen is supposed to look like flies, there are many aspects of the fly we see in reality missing.
